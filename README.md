This is Dune API. A comprehensive Public RESTful API to obtain data about Frank Herbert's Dune Universe. The API includes data about the Books, Films,
Characters, Planets and Quotes present in the Dune Universe. Much more data will be added later also. 

#### Authentication
No authentication needed to use the Dune API since it is intended to be a public API.

Please note that some rate-limiting capabilities have been introduced to mitigate any possible over-uses. But the allocated request amount is more than
enouth to obtain all the data present in the API.

data gradually.
